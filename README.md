# Processor Design
CSE3215-DigitalLogicDesign

This project involves the design and implementation of a processor that supports 
specific instruction set architecture (ISA). The processor is developed using Logisim 
and Verilog HDL. Additionally, an assembler is implemented to convert assembly 
language instructions into machine code. The project phases include designing the 
ISA, developing the processor in Logisim, implementing it in Verilog HDL, and 
testing the design thoroughly.
